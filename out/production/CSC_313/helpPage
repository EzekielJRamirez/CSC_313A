This page is to give more information on each assignment

generate random numbers from 0 to max
        Random r = new Random();
        int val = r.nextInt(max);

rounding, ceiling and floor
    __   __
    |     | ceiling rounding rounds up a value to next whole unit

    |_ _| floor rounds number down to previous whole unit

shortcut commands
shift + ctrl + f10  --> play main method in the program
shift + f10         --> play the whole page including every class of the program
                        you are looking at. also plays main method too
ctrl + alt + l      --> cleans the code to look nice
alt + f12           --> open terminal

Complexities
1. Constant: O(1)
    time:compute answer with closed form equation.

    space:you have a set of variables, all declared at the start of program
    ready to store values and be used in calculations

2. Logarithmic: O(log(n))
    time:at each step, check only half of remaining data

    space:you only need to store a subset of data. You capture this data
    in progressively halved quantities

3. Linear: O(n)
    time:a loop that is only one level deep

    space:you have a data structure that stores all your inputs to the program

4. Greater than Linear, less than polynomial: O(n * log(n))
    time:
    space:
5. Polynomial: O(n^c)
    time:
    space:
6. Exponential: O(c^n)

    space:
7. Factorial: O(n!)
